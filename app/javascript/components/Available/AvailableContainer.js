                General info on sales and shipping. The health,sex, genetics of
                all boas is guaranteed on pickup/shipment arrival. I ship using
                ShipYourReptiles and all shipments are sent FedEx Overnight
                which delivers around 10:30am in most areas. Shipping is a flat
                rate of $50 per box. If the weather is below 65 degrees or above
                90 degrees shipments must be sent to a FedEx Ship Center! A 25%
                non-refundable down payment is required to hold any boas for
                more than 24 hours. Payment plans are available for purchases
                over $500. Discounts are offered for local sales (i.e. no
                shipping) and multiple purchases. Send me an email if you have
                any questions!
