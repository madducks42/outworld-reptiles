      <p>
        Outworld Reptiles is owned by Maddox Grey, a long time reptile
        enthusiast. Our current projects are based around Boa Constrictors;
        including several different BCI morphs, Blood Boas, and a small BCO
        project revolving around a high pink line of Argentine Boas, please
        refer to the Collections page for more information.
      </p>
      <p>
        We typically only have a couple litters a year, once the babies are
        established they will be posted to the For Sale page. If you have any
        questions please contact us at outworldreptiles@gmail.com.
